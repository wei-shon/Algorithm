# Product-Of-Digits
For a given non-negative integer number N, find the minimal natural Q such that the product of all digits of Q is equal N.
## Input
The first line of input contains one positive integer number, which is the number of data sets. Each subsequent line contains one data set which consists of one non-negative integer number N (0 ≤N≤
109).
## Output
For each data set, write one line containing the corresponding natural number Q or ‘-1’ if Q does not exist.
