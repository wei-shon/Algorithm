# Cool Word
A word is a string of lower-case letters. A cool word has at least 2 different letters and the number of occurrences of each different letter is different.
Here is a formal definition. Let w be a word and S be the set of letters in word w, then w is cool if and only if all f(c) (for each character c in S) is all different. Here f(c) means the number of occurrences of c in w.
For example, the word “ada” is cool because f(a) = 2, f(d) = 1, and they’re different. “banana” is also cool because f(a) = 3, f(n) = 2, f(b) = 1. But the word “bbacccd” is not cool because f(a) = f(d) = 1. Some other interesting cool words include: mammal, needed, papaya, referee, senselessness.
Read a list of words and count the number of cool words.
## Input
There will be at most 30 test cases. Each case begins with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), the number of test cases. Following line will contain an integer m ( 1 ≤ n ≤ 10000), the number of words to check. Each of the following n lines contains a word containing at least one and at most 30 letters.
## Output
For each test case, print the case number and the number of cool words.
